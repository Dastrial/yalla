# MicroYalla

## Kernel Linear Logic Library

Contains definitions of linear logic systems (classical linear logic and intuitionistic linear logic) compatible with the [Yalla library](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/olivier.laurent/yalla/).

To be used as a kernel library for certifying proofs in linear logic, typically as certificates for proofs generated by automatic provers.
